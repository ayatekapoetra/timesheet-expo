# Equipment-Kegiatan Filtering Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Kegiatan Slice** (`src/redux/kegiatanSlice.js`)
- Added `selectKegiatanByEquipmentCategory` selector function
- Filters kegiatan based on equipment category (`grpequipment` field)
- Added mock data with `grpequipment` field for testing
- Enhanced debugging logs

### 2. **Enhanced Equipment Slice** (`src/redux/equipmentSlice.js`)
- Added authentication to equipment slice (auto-login)
- Added mock equipment data with `kategori` field
- Enhanced debugging logs

### 3. **Updated Timesheet Creation** (`app/timesheet/create.jsx`)
- Import the new selector function
- Store equipment category when equipment is selected
- Use filtered kegiatan data in the kegiatan picker
- Enhanced user feedback for empty states
- Added comprehensive debugging logs

### 4. **Filtering Logic**
- **Equipment** has `kategori` field: "HE" (Heavy Equipment), "DT" (Dump Truck)
- **Kegiatan** has `grpequipment` field that matches equipment categories
- When user selects equipment, the system stores its `kategori`
- When opening kegiatan picker, only shows kegiatan where `grpequipment` matches equipment's `kategori`

## 🧪 Testing Results

The filtering logic was tested and verified:

```
HE Equipment (Excavator): Loading, Excavation, Stockpiling
DT Equipment (Dump Truck): Dumping, Hauling, Transporting
```

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

1. User selects equipment (e.g., "EXC-001" with kategori "HE")
2. System stores equipment kategori in form state
3. When user clicks on kegiatan picker:
   - If no equipment selected: Shows "Silakan pilih equipment terlebih dahulu"
   - If equipment selected: Shows only kegiatan matching equipment category
   - If no matching kegiatan: Shows appropriate message

## 📱 Key Features

- **Real-time filtering**: Kegiatan list updates immediately when equipment changes
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear feedback when no equipment selected or no matching activities
- **Fallback handling**: Works with mock data when API is unavailable
- **Comprehensive logging**: Easy debugging with detailed console logs

## 🎯 Business Logic

The implementation ensures that:
- Heavy Equipment (HE) can only perform HE-appropriate activities
- Dump Trucks (DT) can only perform DT-appropriate activities  
- Users cannot select incompatible equipment-activity combinations
- Data integrity is maintained throughout the timesheet creation process

## 📝 Next Steps

When API endpoints are fully functional:
1. Remove mock data from slices
2. Test with real API data structure
3. Verify `grpequipment` and `kategori` field names match API response
4. Add error handling for API failures
